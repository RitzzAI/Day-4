# Day 4 - Advanced Python 🚀

In this notebook and script, I explored some advanced and very useful Python functions:

### 🔧 Topics Covered:
- `lambda` expressions (anonymous functions)
- `map()` for transforming iterables
- `filter()` for filtering data
- `reduce()` from `functools` for cumulative operations

### 📁 Files:
- `lambda_map_filter_reduce.ipynb`: Practice notebook with examples and explanations.
- `lambda_examples.py`: Clean Python script version of the notebook.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Functional programming concepts help make code cleaner and faster.
- These tools are super useful for data processing in real-world datasets.

### 📌 Try It Yourself:
Clone the repo and run the notebook in Jupyter!
